# Kubernetes the hard Way automated
Based on the tutorial of sensei Kelsey Hightower. This will work you through the way of initializing a kubernetes cluster using terraform and ansible. You will see at the end the final result. It is for learning purpose even though there is is project that I started to build terraform and ansible script to setup kubernetes and upgrade it with just some configuration files. This is not for people who are looking for a fully automated way of deploying but for people a want to learn a way they can automate it themselves. This tutorial will be done with cloud.ca. It is not very popular at the time. Feels free to write your terraform for another cloud provider depending on your preferences.
